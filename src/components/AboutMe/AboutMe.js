            <h2>A Little About Myself</h2>
            <p>My social life consists mostly of spending time with my wife and son, playing the guitar, and traveling the world.</p>
            <p>My background in web development began with Thinkfulâ€™s Engineering Immersion Program. Web development, since then, has been a passion of mine because making ideas come to life through technology is extremely satisfying.</p>
            <p>I have a lifetime full of experience of being a team player by playing in various music bands and sports teams, I have been a member of various clubs and organizations throughout my college career, and I am extremely passionate about coding. This is why I am confident I will be a great asset to any team of web developers.</p>
