            <h2>A Little About Myself</h2>
            <p>I am a software engineer with enterprise-level experience in building high-traffic, public-facing, mobile-first, responsive full-stack web applications in an agile/scrum environment utilizing JavaScript, React, Redux, Java, Spring, and SQL. I enjoy delivering objectives while learning new material, as well as building social relationships with coworkers. I am currently looking for a remote-work opportunity where I can be a valuable asset with my professional experience and soft skills.</p>
            <p>My social life consists mostly of spending time with my wife and son, playing the guitar, and traveling the world.</p>
