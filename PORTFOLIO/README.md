I am an aspiring full-stack web developer whose favorite JavaScript library is REACT. My social life consists mostly of spending time with my wife and son, playing the guitar, and traveling the world.

My background in web development began with Thinkfulâ€™s Engineering Immersion Program. Coding, since then, has been a passion of mine because making ideas come to life through technology is extremely satisfying.

I have a lifetime full of experience of being a team player by playing in various music bands and sports teams, I have been a member of various clubs and organizations throughout my college career, and I am extremely passionate about coding. This is why I am confident I will be a great asset to any team of web developers.
